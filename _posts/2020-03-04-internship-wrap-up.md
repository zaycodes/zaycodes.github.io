Wow, it's 3 months already, I'm excited to be completing my internship with Wikimedia. Yes, I said excited, this internship has been a wonderful experience for me. It has helped in building my developer experience skills, technical writing skills, communication skills and so much more. It has also exposed me to working remotely. I'm excited about moving on to the next phase in my career. 
During my internship with Wikimedia, my project was to work on documentation improvements to the ~20 top 100 most viewed MediaWiki Action API pages on-wiki and if time permits, develop a bot that mass edits sample code from [this repository](https://github.com/wikimedia/MediaWiki-Action-API-Code-Samples) to the API namespace on MediaWiki.org and vice-versa, as explained in https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-api-demos/issues/172. 

Things were a bit slow at the beginning of my internship as I wasn't familiar with mediawiki APIs, wroking on some pages required more research than I had anticipated. I had to test the APIs throughly in order to document them properly and this took some getting used to.

At the middle of the internship the second part of the project which was to develop a bot was changed to improving more pages. Due to the limited time, I wasn't able to work on all the pages that needed improvement but I was able to improve 33 pages. This entailed writing sample codes in Javascript, PHP, Python and Mediawikijs for some of these pages, removing obsolete contents, updating the pages with up-to-date information, restructuring the contents to match the set standard in the [documentation template](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Documentation_template) and finally passing through a review with my mentor. While there were times where I had issues that took time to resolve, resources from past mentors and my mentor's constant support and willingness to help, also made things alot smoother for me. 

Links to pages I worked on as well as pull requests can be found on my Mediawiki user page [Zaycodes](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Zaycodes). For people who are interested in contributing to Mediawiki, you can go through the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-api-demos/blob/master/contributing.md) and [issues](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-api-demos/issues) in the github repository. Here is also a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ABmUQbz1LEpeJshi7I3INmxFIiWCWU7gxe7DYi_3Rc/edit?usp=sharing) I compiled of pages that needed to be worked on, the ones highlighted in green are the pages I was able to work on, while the rest of them still needs improvement and are open to be worked on by anyone.

While my outreachy internship ends with Wikimedia, I do not intend to stop contributing to Mediawiki, I intend to keep working on the reamianing pages and I also hope to later get into actually improving the APIs and not just the documention.

I am really gratefull to Outreachy and Mediawiki for giving me this wonderful opportunity. Special thanks to my Mentor Jerop Brenda, Srishti Sethi, and Mediawiki's wonderful community for all the help and support given to me through out my internship.
