A voucher generation microservice application that generates three different types of Vouchers which include Gift voucher, Value voucher and a Discount voucher and redeems these vouchers. The voucher generation service was built with C# on .NET core framework with Mongodb as the database while the Redemption service was built with Java on Springboot with mssql as the database. I used Keycloak for user management and authentication, hangfire to run background tasks to improve user experience when generating multiple vouchers at a time and rabbitmq as a message broker between the two services.
